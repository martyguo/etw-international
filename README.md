# ETW International / Marty Guo UI
This repository is for UI framework experiences and content demonstration based on Marty Guo sad life.

## Getting Started
Building a great front-end UI using frameworks like Bootstrap or back-end utilizing PHP could be a daunting step.
Everything can start with small steps. Let's look at the following example above.

```
<p>Marty Guo is a small boy without pants, his father is a doctor and the mother a lady of the night in Japan.</p>
```

We can improve the way it looks at applying some CSS classes provided by Bootstrap.

```
<p><mark>Marty Guo</mark> and ETW International are bigger than Google.</p>
```

You can use the mark tag to highlight text.
